# Campus Copilot: System Architecture Design

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the system architecture for the Campus Copilot AI agent, a Telegram-based chatbot designed to assist students with various college-related queries and tasks. The agent will provide information on timetables, exams, events, club activities, deadlines, summarize notices/emails, convert event information into various formats, interface with external APIs like Google Calendar and Google Maps, and offer personalized reminders.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

The Campus Copilot will follow a modular, microservices-oriented architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. The core components will include:

*   **Telegram Bot Interface:** Handles communication with users via the Telegram Bot API.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Module:** Processes user queries, identifies intents, and extracts entities.
*   **Knowledge Base & Database:** Stores college-specific information (timetables, events, deadlines) and user data.
*   **External API Integrations:** Connects to Google Calendar, Google Maps, and potentially college LMS/SIS.
*   **Utility Modules:** Provides functionalities like summarization, content generation (posters, mail drafts), and personalized reminders.

## 3. Detailed Component Breakdown

### 3.1. Telegram Bot Interface

This component will be responsible for:

*   Receiving incoming messages from Telegram users.
*   Sending responses back to users.
*   Handling various message types (text, commands, inline queries).
*   Managing user sessions and states.

**Recommended Technologies:**

*   **Python Telegram Bot Library:** A popular and robust library for building Telegram bots in Python.

### 3.2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Module

This module will be the brain of the chatbot, enabling it to understand and respond to natural language queries. Key functionalities include:

*   **Intent Recognition:** Identifying the user's goal (e.g., 


querying timetable, asking about events, setting a reminder).
*   **Entity Extraction:** Identifying key information within the query (e.g., specific course name, date, event type, classroom location).
*   **Dialogue Management:** Maintaining context across multiple turns of conversation.

**Recommended Technologies:**

*   **SpaCy or NLTK:** For basic NLP tasks like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
*   **Hugging Face Transformers (with pre-trained models like BERT/RoBERTa):** For more advanced intent recognition and semantic understanding, especially if fine-tuning on college-specific data is feasible.
*   **Rasa or Google Dialogflow:** For comprehensive dialogue management, intent recognition, and entity extraction, offering a more structured approach to building conversational AI.

### 3.3. Knowledge Base & Database

This component will store all the static and dynamic information required by the chatbot to answer queries and manage user data.

*   **College Information:** Timetables, course catalogs, faculty details, exam schedules, event listings, club information, deadlines, campus maps, etc.
*   **User Data:** User preferences, personalized reminders, past interactions, authentication tokens for external services.

**Recommended Technologies:**

*   **PostgreSQL or MongoDB:** For storing structured and unstructured college data. PostgreSQL is suitable for relational data like timetables, while MongoDB can be used for more flexible data like event descriptions or notices.
*   **Pinecone (or similar vector database):** For storing embeddings of documents (notices, emails, FAQs) to enable semantic search and summarization (RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation).

### 3.4. External API Integrations

This module will handle secure communication with various external services to fetch and push data.

*   **Google Calendar API:** For retrieving upcoming events, creating personal reminders, and managing student schedules.
    *   **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 for secure user authorization.
    *   **Best Practices:** Implement exponential backoff for API calls, handle rate limits, use push notifications for real-time updates.
*   **Google Maps API:** For locating classrooms, campus buildings, and providing directions.
*   **College LMS/SIS API (if available):** For accessing student-specific data like grades, attendance, and personalized announcements. This integration would require coordination with the college IT department and adherence to their specific API documentation and security protocols.

**Recommended Technologies:**

*   **Google API Client Library for Python:** For seamless interaction with Google services.
*   **`requests` library:** For general HTTP requests to other RESTful APIs.

### 3.5. Utility Modules

These modules will provide additional functionalities to enhance the chatbot's capabilities.

*   **Summarization Module:** To condense long notices, emails, or documents into concise summaries.
    *   **Recommended Technologies:** Pre-trained summarization models from Hugging Face Transformers (e.g., BART, T5).
*   **Content Generation Module:** To convert raw event information into formatted posters, detailed descriptions, or mail drafts.
    *   **Recommended Technologies:** Image generation libraries (e.g., Pillow for basic image manipulation, or potentially `media_generate_image` tool for more advanced AI-driven image generation if available and suitable for poster creation), templating engines (e.g., Jinja2) for text generation.
*   **Reminder Service:** To send personalized notifications to students based on their schedules or habits.
    *   **Recommended Technologies:** A task scheduler (e.g., Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ) for managing and triggering reminders.

## 4. Data Flow

1.  **User Input:** A student sends a message to the Telegram bot.
2.  **Telegram Bot Interface:** Receives the message and forwards it to the NLP Module.
3.  **NLP Module:** Processes the message, identifies the intent and extracts entities. It then determines which backend service or knowledge base query is required.
4.  **Backend Services/Knowledge Base:**
    *   If the query requires information from the **Knowledge Base & Database**, the NLP module queries the relevant database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB/Pinecone).
    *   If the query requires external data, the **External API Integrations** module is invoked (e.g., Google Calendar API for events, Google Maps API for locations, or College LMS/SIS API).
    *   If the query involves summarization or content generation, the **Utility Modules** are used.
5.  **Response Generation:** The retrieved information or generated content is formatted into a human-readable response.
6.  **Telegram Bot Interface:** Sends the response back to the student.

## 5. Security Considerations

*   **API Keys and Credentials:** Store all API keys and sensitive credentials securely using environment variables or a secrets management service.
*   **User Data Privacy:** Adhere to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, FERPA) when handling student information. Implement proper access controls and encryption for sensitive data.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication for users accessing personalized features and ensure proper authorization for API calls.
*   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## 6. Scalability and Deployment

*   **Containerization (Docker):** Package the application and its dependencies into Docker containers for consistent deployment across different environments.
*   **Orchestration (Kubernetes):** For large-scale deployments, Kubernetes can manage and scale the containers.
*   **Cloud Platforms:** Deploy the bot on cloud platforms like Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS, or Azure, leveraging their managed services for databases, computing, and serverless functions.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to track bot performance, identify errors, and ensure smooth operation.

## 7. Future Enhancements

*   **Personalized Learning Paths:** Integrate with LMS to suggest relevant courses or study materials based on student performance.
*   **Peer-to-Peer Support:** Facilitate connections between students for study groups or project collaborations.
*   **Mental Health Resources:** Provide quick access to campus mental health services and resources.
*   **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a system for students to provide feedback on the bot's responses and features.

This concludes the initial system architecture design. Further detailed design and implementation will follow in subsequent phases.
